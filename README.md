# customer_behavior_analysis
data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using python,sql and power bi
📊 Data Analytics Project
🧭 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from raw data to insights and visualization.
It involves:

Loading and exploring data in Python

Cleaning and transforming data for analysis

Running SQL queries on a PostgreSQL server

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard

Summarizing key findings in a presentation (PPT) and report created using Gamma

🗂️ Dataset

Name: ( Customer Behavior Dataset)

Source: (public source)

Description: Contains information about customers, their demographics, and purchasing behavior.

Size: (e.g., 10,000 rows × 12 columns)

Format: CSV file

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools Used
Programming	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Database	PostgreSQL, pgAdmin
Visualization	Power BI
Reporting	Gamma App (for slides and reports)
Other	Jupyter Notebook
🚀 Steps Followed
1. Data Loading & Exploration (Python)

Imported the dataset using Pandas

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends, missing values, and distributions

2. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values

Renamed columns and standardized formats

Removed irrelevant or inconsistent entries

3. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Imported the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL

Executed analytical queries using JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregations

Extracted insights like top customers, product sales, and trends

4. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Connected PostgreSQL data to Power BI

Created interactive visuals (KPIs, charts, filters)

Designed a clean and insightful dashboard for decision-making

5. Report & Presentation (Gamma)

Summarized analysis findings and visuals

Created a clear presentation highlighting objectives, methods, insights, and recommendations
